To get your Nginx server with PHP 8.3 up and running on WSL 2 Docker using the files you've provided, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're in the correct directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. It should be in the `/docker` folder.

2. Open a terminal in WSL 2 and navigate to the `/docker` directory:

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/docker/folder
   ```

3. Run the following command to build and start the containers:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the custom PHP image defined in your Dockerfile
   - Pull the Nginx image if it's not already present
   - Create and start the containers in detached mode (-d flag)

4. Once the process is complete, your services should be up and running. You can verify this by running:

   ```
   docker-compose ps
   ```

   This should show you two containers running: one for PHP (app) and one for Nginx.

5. To access your PHP info page, open a web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   You should see the PHP info page, which confirms that Nginx is serving your PHP files correctly.

Additional notes:

- If you make changes to your Dockerfile or need to rebuild the images, you can use:

  ```
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```

- To stop the containers, run:

  ```
  docker-compose down
  ```

- If you need to view logs, you can use:

  ```
  docker-compose logs
  ```

  Or for a specific service:

  ```
  docker-compose logs app
  ```
  or
  ```
  docker-compose logs nginx
  ```

- Make sure your WSL 2 instance has Docker installed and running properly.

- If you encounter any permission issues, you might need to adjust the permissions of your `src` directory to ensure Docker can read/write to it.

These steps should get your Nginx server with PHP 8.3 up and running on WSL 2 Docker based on the configuration files you've provided. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further clarification!
